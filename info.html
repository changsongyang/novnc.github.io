      <p>If you want to integrate the core noVNC library into your project, you
        should check out the
        <a href="https://github.com/novnc/noVNC/blob/master/docs/API.md">
          API documentation</a>. To easily get the core library you can use
        <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM</a>:
        <pre>npm install @novnc/novnc</pre>
        Please note that what's available on NPM is <b>not</b> the full noVNC
        client, it's only the core modules/library and is lacking a user
        application.
